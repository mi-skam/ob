

- TypeChat is a project released on GitHub by Anders Hejlsberg and his team.
- It provides a **schema-based approach** to interact with AI models, as opposed to traditional prompt engineering.
- Instead of giving text prompts or JSON data to AI models, users can define a schema in TypeScript and use it to interact with the models.
- The schema allows for more precise control over the data received from the AI models.
- To get started with TypeChat, users can clone the repository, configure a .env file with API keys, and use the provided examples to run interactions with the AI model based on the defined schema.
