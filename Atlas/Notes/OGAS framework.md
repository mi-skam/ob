# [OGAS framework](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/OGAS+framework)

The OGAS framework facilitates the creation of characters by prompting [writers](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Writing) to think of the character's:

- Occupation
- Goal
- Attitude
- Stake


## Occupation

A character's occupation may dictate their default activity. A guard will be doing a different thing from a king, when left up to their own devices.

## Goal

The character's goal is an objective that they want to achieve that could align or extend beyond their occupation. This could be an obvious goal, like protecting the king, to an ulterior motive, like gaining renown or money.

## Attitude

The character's attitude is, to some extent, dictated by the previous two factors, but it may also describe what the character is like when neither their occupation nor goal is dictating their behavior. Are they typically confrontational, or afraid?

## Stake

Stake defines a character's resistance: how much (or how little) they deviate from the previous three factors. A fighter who knows her opponent's blade is poisoned will fight more carefully and intentionally than one that does not.
