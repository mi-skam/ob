Calculate the sum of experience with reduce 
(This calculation is actually nonsense, as we only take one language in each position into account ðŸ¤ª, we fix this in the third example)
```javascript
const positions = [
	{ languages: ["HTML", "JavaScript", "PHP"], years: 4 },
	{ languages: ["JavaScript", "PHP"], years: 2 },
	{ languages: ["C", "PHP"], years: 3 },
];
const result = positions.reduce((acc, position) => {
  return acc + position.years
}, 0)

console.log(result)
```

Calculate the sum of experience with each language

```js
const positions = [
	{ languages: ["HTML", "JavaScript", "PHP"], years: 4 },
	{ languages: ["JavaScript", "PHP"], years: 2 },
	{ languages: ["C", "PHP"], years: 3 },
];

const result = positions.reduce((result, {languages, years}) => {
  languages.forEach(l => {
    result[l] = result[l] ? result[l] + years : years
  })
  return result
}, {})

console.log(result)
```

```js
const langExperience = { HTML: 4, JavaScript: 6, PHP: 9, C: 3 }

const totalYears = Object.keys(langExperience).reduce((total, key) => {
  return total + langExperience[key]
}, 0)

console.log(totalYears)
```
