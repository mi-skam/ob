_Computational processes_ are abstract things inhabiting computers

_Computational processes_ manipulate abstract things called _data_

This evolution of a process is called _program_

We program to direct theses processes.

## Expressions

Expression statements are an expression followed by a semicolon, e.G. `386;`

A compound expression is a expression which is combined with an operator, e.G. `-3`

Expressions that contain other expressions as components are called combinations.

Combinations that are formed by an operator symbol are called operator combinations, e.G. `(3 * 4)`

$x = 16$
$\sqrt{x} = 4$
$\frac{x}{\sqrt{x}}=x^{1 - \frac{1}{2}}=x^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{x}$
