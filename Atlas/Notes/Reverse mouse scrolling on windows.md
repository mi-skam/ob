Open this path in the registry editor
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\HID`

Expand the key (folder) that matches the "VID ID" of your mouse â€” for example, **VID_0E0F&PID_0003&MI_01** (you get this via device manager)

Change **FlipFlopWheel** DWORD and set the value from **0** to **1**.

Restart the computer.
