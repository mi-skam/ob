It's rather important to get unit-tests done, for JavaScript [[jest]] is quite popular, but as we already using [[vite]] we might use [[vitest]] as well, which is supposed to be quite compatible with *jest* anyway.

I follow the definition of Roy Osherove in  "The art of unit testing"[^1]  is a piece of code, that calls another piece of code and compares it with expected values.

## expect / match
## handle asynchronous code
## mock functions (apis)
## setup / teardown
	isolate the behaviour even more, by guaranteeing the data is setup or removed as needed for the specific tests.
