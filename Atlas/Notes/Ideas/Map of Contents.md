Map of Contents are a structure to get an overview of related notes. They help to have an overview or get cues from content which is connected as well. 

## When to use MOCs

[[Nick Milos]] says a you should start to create `MOCs` when you start to feel "overwhelmed" by the missing structure of those bites of knowledge and start to "cartograph" them into "maps of contents.".

## Why use MOCs
1. Help to **manage anxiety** by providing a dedicated spot for related notes 
2. **Encourage exploring and creating** from there
3. **Reference** and **navigation**
4. Easier to flex and modify than `folders 
5. Create a **spatial relationship** which makes it easier to recall (Method of Loci)
