[[Evergreen notes]] are notes that have developed a certain maturity through refactoring and refining. Here are the important properties:

- **Clear and Concise**
	- title can be a clear title or statement
	- like a mini-thesis
- **Own words**
- **Linked**
- **Non-static** 
	- you still "change" them as you encounter new things
