- 🔥 `On` For the most active efforts and projects
- ♻️ `Ongoing` For broder, ongoing efforts
- 〜 `Simmering` For back of mind efforts
- 💤 `Sleeping` For everything else (random, done, cold storage, ...)

## Workflow

**See to Remember**: See at a glance

- What's on?
- What's ongoing?
- What's missing? 
	- Take a peak into Simmering

**Adjust & Rank**: Quickly prioritize your efforts and budget your bandwidth

- What efforts need their intensity adjusted?
	- Are there active efforts in "on" that need to be moved to Simmering because you don't have the bandwidth for them right now? 
	- Are there active efforts in "on" that need to be moved to Sleeping because you have completed them?
- What efforts need their rank adjusted?
	- Within each level of intensity
- Did any efforts change in scope or scale?
	- Many times ongoing efforts spin out a new sub effort.
	- Many times efforts turned "on" grow into "ongoing" efforts.

> [!key]- Best Practices for Effort Management
> - `On` should be less than 10
> - `Ongoing` should be less than 10
> - Their total should be less than 20
