You start making notes to a topic. Later on you create some more notes to the topic (or even create one big note, which you might separate into smaller notes later)

In the first phase you often collect your thoughts in time based [[Calendar]] notes, but they can come from all kinds of sources, a book read, a paper from Zotero. It's not important, you mainly **gather the links** into what **becomes the MOC**

The second Phase - **collide** - is a very interesting one. All the ideas of the linked sources "battle for spatial positioning":
	- how are they related?
	- what is redundant?
	- what is the structure?
	- the pattern?
	- the size of the notes?

To do that, copy all them in the future MOC. Add your thoughts of the process into the note as well (answering those questions we mentioned). You can do it like a Journal (Day 1, Day 2, ...)


 

- Three Phases
	- Gather
	- Collide
	- Navigate
