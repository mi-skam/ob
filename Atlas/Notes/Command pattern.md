Yes, the Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

Here's a basic structure of the Command pattern:

1. **Command**: This is an interface that declares a method for a particular action.

2. **ConcreteCommand**: This class extends the Command interface, implementing the `execute` method, which calls on the receiver's method, associated with the command.

3. **Invoker**: This is the class that uses the Command to perform an action. It interacts with the ConcreteCommand objects.

4. **Receiver**: This is the class that performs the associated command action. It knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
// Receiver
class Light {
  turnOn() {
    console.log('Light is on');
  }

  turnOff() {
    console.log('Light is off');
  }
}

// Command
class LightOnCommand {
  constructor(light) {
    this.light = light;
  }

  execute() {
    this.light.turnOn();
  }
}

class LightOffCommand {
  constructor(light) {
    this.light = light;
  }

  execute() {
    this.light.turnOff();
  }
}

// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
  submit(command) {
    command.execute();
  }
}

const light = new Light();
const lightOn = new LightOnCommand(light);
const lightOff = new LightOffCommand(light);

const remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.submit(lightOn);  // Outputs: 'Light is on'
remote.submit(lightOff); // Outputs: 'Light is off'
```

In this example, `Light` is a receiver, `LightOnCommand` and `LightOffCommand` are concrete commands, and `RemoteControl` is an invoker. The invoker (remote control) does not need to know anything about what the command does, it just knows that when it calls `execute()`, the command will do what it needs to do.
