> During my first semester as a wood design student, I've explored different techniques and materials to create functional yet aesthetically pleasing pieces. The natural beauty and versatility of wood have inspired me to experiment with different textures, grains, and finishes, creating pieces that highlight both the qualities of the wood and my own design sensibility.
> 
> For my upcoming works, I plan to focus on combining wood with other materials, such as metal and glass, to create pieces that push the boundaries of traditional wood design. Through my work, I aim to showcase the craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into each piece, and to demonstrate how wood can be used to create pieces that are not only beautiful but also serve a practical purpose.
> 
> At the heart of my artistic approach is a passion for wood and a respect for the traditions and history of wood design. I look forward to continuing my studies, honing my skills, and pushing the limits of what can be achieved with this versatile and timeless material

## Introduction

- my name: Charlotte Blume
- my studies: wood and furniture designe 
- Why did I choose to study design (Background)
    - I had been in trained in culture and media pedagogy
    - unfulfilled ambition/goals/targets/wishes.


## What am I doing? (Which kind of art am I doing?)

- craftmanship
    - doing woodturning 
    - laser cutting
    - carving

- digital art
    - doing digital layouts
    - taking photos

## Artistic Process
1
- craftmanship: imitiation, observation, a lot of learning, hone the skills, trial-and-error
- digital art: researching a lot, looking for inspiration, colors are important, 

**strong contrasts** are often a great way of steering attention towards an object 

delicate objects in contrast to robust, or heavy or strong parts

contrasts in materials and their perception in space


sketching: placement of objects in space is improved, easier to create rough sketches,
easier to correct mistakes, easier to literaly approach the motive through different angles

unorthodox materials / upcycling materials in the context of sustainability

## Influences

example wire-sculpts ("Gego"), drawing without paper - kinetic arts and lines

olafur eliasson, impressed by the scale of the works, and to have the impression that the work - often with the help of optical lenses - is kind of interactive. although it's not really interactive in a sense that you push a button, but it find its way to reflect back through the eyes of the observer. 

everyday curiosities

artistic collaboration

newspaper woods

# Artist statement
As a student of wood and furniture design, I have developed an interest in creating something tangible, functional, and beautiful. My training in cultural and media pedagogy made me realize that I want to put emphasis on my own creative processes instead of teaching others. This has inspired me to pursue a career in design.

In the first semester I mainly was learning and applying woodturning, laser cutting, and carving. I am honing my skills and experimenting with different materials and techniques. Playing with the idea of using the interplay between materials and perception in space.

My artistic process is grounded in research, observation, and trial and error. Whether I am working with wood or digital media. Sketching is an important part of my process, as it allows me to approach my motives from different angles and correct mistakes more easily. I also enjoy using unorthodox materials and upcycling practices as part of my commitment to sustainability.

My artistic influences include Gego's wire sculptures and kinetic art, Olafur Eliasson's optical works, and everyday curiosities. I am also interested in artistic collaboration and exploring new materials, such as newspaper woods.

I look forward to continuing my studies and exploring my artistic identity.  Right now, it's early days, but I could imagine myself in the future of combining my former training with the my design education.
