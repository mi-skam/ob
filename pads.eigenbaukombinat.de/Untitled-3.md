## Why do we need ML?


- we want to grade the user doing those activities, observing them with the webcams of their mobile phones

## Approach

- Create a motion capture of a person doing the exercises with the help of [FreeMoCap](https://freemocap.org/)
- Create a 3D simulation with Unity / Unreal to create a diverse set of inputs for the training phase
- Create the images from within the simulation
- Feed the model
