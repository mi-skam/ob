## Agenda

Weitermachen

## Log

- Learned how to use [opencv-jupiter-ui](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-jupyter-ui/) widget to display the opencv window as a separate frame. Very useful for live testing.
	- replace `cv2.imshow()` with `jcv2.imshow()` and so on
- We can use the `mp.drawing` and `mp.drawing_styles` functions without passing it to html/js ourselves. It just works.

## Next Actions
#todo/person/benjamin 
- [x] Benjamin tries to get the handle on drawing_styles and got the task to change the torso to blue and the head to orange
- [x] Create a date with Marek S. Tatara and Benjamin
